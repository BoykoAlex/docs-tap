# Installing part I: prerequisites, EULA, and CLI

This document describes the first part of the installation process for Tanzu Application Platform:

+ [Prerequisites](#prereqs)
+ [Accept the EULAs](#eulas)
+ [Install Cluster Essentials for VMware Tanzu](#tanzu-cluster-essentials)
+ [Install or Update the Tanzu CLI and plug-ins](#cli-and-plugin)


## <a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

The following are required to install Tanzu Application Platform:

### Tanzu Network and container image registry requirements

Installation requires:

* A [Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/) account to download
Tanzu Application Platform packages.

* A container image registry, such as [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) or
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) with at least **10&nbsp;GB** of available storage for
application images, base images, and runtime dependencies.
When available, VMware recommends using a paid registry account to avoid potential rate-limiting associated with some free registry offerings.

* Registry credentials with push and write access made available to Tanzu Application Platform to
store images.

* Network access to https://registry.tanzu.vmware.com

* Network access to your chosen container image registry.

* Latest version of Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
Tanzu Application Platform GUI currently does not support Safari browser.

* After your installation is complete, you must identify at least one Developer Namespace. [Instructions for setting up a Developer Namespace](install-components.md#setup) are available at the end of installation.

#### DNS Records
There are some optional but recommended DNS records you should allocate if you decide to use these particular components:

- Cloud Native Runtimes (knative) - Allocate a wildcard subdomain for your developer's applications. This is specified in the `cnrs.domain_name` key of the `tap-values.yml` configuration file that you input with the installation. This wildcard should be pointed at the external IP address of the `tanzu-system-ingress`'s `envoy` service.
- Tanzu Learning Center - Similar to Cloud Native Runtimes, allocate a wildcard subdomain for your workshops and content. This is specified in the `learningcenter.ingressDomain` key of the `tap-values.yml` configuration file that you input with the installation. This wildcard should be pointed at the external IP address of the `tanzu-system-ingress`'s `envoy` service.
- Tanzu Application Platform GUI - Should you decide to implement the share ingress and include the Tanzu Application Platform GUI, allocate a fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that can be pointed at the `tanzu-system-ingress` service.
The default hostname consists of `tap-gui` plus an `IngressDomain` of your choice. For example,
`tap-gui.example.com`.


#### Tanzu Application Platform GUI

- Git repository for the Tanzu Application Platform GUI's software catalogs, along with a token allowing read access.
  Supported Git infrastructure includes:
    - GitHub
    - GitLab
    - Azure DevOps
- Tanzu Application Platform GUI Blank Catalog from the Tanzu Application section of Tanzu Network
  - To install this, navigate to [Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/) and select the Tanzu Application Platform. Under the list of available files to download, there is a folder titled `tap-gui-catalogs`. Inside that folder is a compressed archive titled `Tanzu Application Platform GUI Blank Catalog`. You must extract that catalog to the preceding Git repository of choice. This serves as the configuration location for your Organization's Catalog inside Tanzu Application Platform GUI.
- The Tanzu Application Platform GUI catalog allows for two approaches towards storing catalog information:
    - The default option uses an in-memory database and is suitable for test and development scenarios.
          This reads the catalog data from Git URLs that you specify in the `tap-values.yml` file.
          This data is temporary, and any operations that cause the `server` pod in the `tap-gui` namespace to be re-created
          also cause this data to be rebuilt from the Git location.
          This can cause issues when you manually register entities through the UI because
          they only exist in the database and are lost when that in-memory database gets rebuilt.
    - For production use-cases, use a PostgreSQL database that exists outside the Tanzu Application Platform's packaging.
          This stores all the catalog data persistently both from the Git locations and the GUI's manual entity registrations.


### Kubernetes cluster requirements
Installation requires:

* Kubernetes cluster versions 1.20, 1.21, or 1.22 on one of the following Kubernetes providers:

    * Azure Kubernetes Service
    * Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
    * Google Kubernetes Engine
        * GKE Autopilot clusters do not have required features enabled
    * Minikube
        * Reference the resource requirements below
        * Hyperkit driver is supported on macOS only; Docker driver is not supported.

### <a id="resource-requirements"></a>Resource requirements

* To deploy all Tanzu Application Platform packages, your cluster must have at least:
    * 8 GB of RAM across all nodes available to Tanzu Application Platform
    * 8 CPUs for i9 (or equivalent) available to Tanzu Application Platform components
    * 12 CPUs for i7 (or equivalent) available to Tanzu Application Platform components
    * 12 GB of RAM is available to build and deploy applications, including Minikube. VMware recommends 16 GB of RAM for an optimal experience.
    * 70 GB of disk space available per node

* For the [`complete` profile](install.html#about-tanzu-application-platform-package-profiles-1), or
    use of Security Chain Security Tools - Store, your cluster must have a configured default StorageClass.

* [Pod Security Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/)
must be configured so that Tanzu Application Platform controller pods can run as root.

### Tools and CLI requirements

Installation requires:

* The Kubernetes CLI, kubectl, v1.20, v1.21 or v1.22, installed and authenticated with administrator rights for your target cluster. See [Install Tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

* To set the Kubernetes cluster context:

    1. List the existing contexts by running:

        ```
        kubectl config get-contexts
        ```

        For example:

        ```
        $ kubectl config get-contexts
        CURRENT   NAME                                CLUSTER           AUTHINFO                                NAMESPACE
                aks-repo-trial                      aks-repo-trial    clusterUser_aks-rg-01_aks-repo-trial
        *       aks-tap-cluster                     aks-tap-cluster   clusterUser_aks-rg-01_aks-tap-cluster
                
        ```

    2.  Set the context to the cluster that you want to use for the Tanzu Application Platform packages install.
        For example, set the context to the `aks-tap-cluster` context by running:

        ```
        kubectl config use-context aks-tap-cluster
        ```

        For example:

        ```
        $ kubectl config use-context aks-tap-cluster
        Switched to context "aks-tap-cluster".
        ```

    ```

    Ensure that you have the `accelerator`, `apps`, `package`, `secret`, and `services` plug-ins.
    You need these plug-ins to install and interact with the Tanzu Application Platform.

    Tanzu Application Platform requires cluster-admin privileges.
    Running commands associated with the additional plug-ins can have unintended side effects.
    VMware recommends against running `cluster`, `kubernetes-release`, `login`, `management-cluster`,
    and `pinniped-auth` commands.

You can now proceed with installing Tanzu Application Platform. For more information, see
**[Installing part II: Profiles](install.md)**.


## <a id='udpate-previous-tap-tanzu-cli'></a>Instructions for updating Tanzu CLI that was installed for a previous release of Tanzu Application Platform
