# Supply Chain Security Tools for VMware Tanzu â€“ Store

Supply Chain Security Tools - Store saves software bills of materials (SBoMs) to a database and allows you to query for image, source, package, and vulnerability relationships.  It integrates with [Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](../scst-scan/overview.md) to automatically store the resulting source and image vulnerability reports.

Supply Chain Security Tools - Store has three components:

* Postgres database
* [API](api.md)
* CLI (`insight`)

## Install

Supply Chain Security Tools - Store is released as an individual Tanzu Application Platform component.

To install, see [Install Supply Chain Security Tools - Store](../install-components.md#install-scst-store).  It will install the Postgres database and an [API](api.md) backend.

> **Note:** the `insight` CLI requires a [separate installation](install_cli.md)

For more information, see [Deployment Details](deployment_details.md).
