# Source Controller

The controller follows the spirit of the FluxCD Source Controller. An [`ImageRepository`](#imagerepository) resource is able to resolve source from the content of an image in an image registry.

For basic troubleshooting Source Controller, see the [Troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting.md).

## Reference documentation

### ImageRepository

```yaml
apiVersion: source.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: ImageRepository
spec:
  image: registry.example/image/repository:tag
  # optional fields
  interval: 5m
  imagePullSecrets: []
  serviceAccountName: default
```

`ImageRepository` resolves source code defined in an OCI image repository, exposing the resulting source artifact at a URL defined by `.status.artifact.url`.

The interval determines how often to check tagged images for changes. Setting this value too high will result in delays in discovering new sources, while setting it too low may trigger a registry's rate limits.

Repository credentials can be defined as image pull secrets. You can reference them either directly from the resources at `.spec.imagePullSecrets` or attach them to a service account referenced at `.spec.serviceAccountName`. The default service account name `"default"` is used if not otherwise specified. The default credential helpers for the registry are also used, for example, pulling from GCR on a GKE cluster.
